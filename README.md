ggimp-tile-stream
=================

A set of GIMP plugins that add functions for dealing with tile streams.

The plugins are designed to make it possible for programs to handle
tiles through the PDB, rather than through gimplib.  The new features
are designed primarily for using tiles via the GIMP D-Bus plugin.
